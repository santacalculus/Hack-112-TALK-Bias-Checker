# Hack112 Fall 2019 Project

Worked with Kian Nassre, Tate Mauzy and Alon Aboodi for 24 hours on this project. Runner-up at Hack112 Hackathon. We wrote an algorithm that detects the political/idealogical bias of a newspaper article and replaces the biased word with an unbiased synonym. It's imperfect, of course, and is a work in progress.
